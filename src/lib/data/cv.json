  "summary": "I started my IT career as a programmer and steadily moved on to IT management positions. I have worked with pretty much everything that runs in data-centers. Most of my work history I have been involved in selecting technologies and building processes for software development or hosting large production environments. Lately I have been working with DevOps and Native Cloud managed services. I am a solution oriented person who makes great effort to help co-workers be more productive. I am a no-nonsense kind of guy who stays focused, but I also have a great sense of humor and welcome feedback.",
